  <h1 class="topictitle1">Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks Benefits</h1>
 
   
  <div> 
    <p> Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB) is a library that helps
      you leverage multi-core performance without having to be a threading expert.
      Typically you can improve performance for multi-core processors by implementing
      the key points explained in the early sections of the Developer Guide. As your
      expertise grows, you may want to dive into more complex subjects that are
      covered in advanced sections. 
    </p>
 
    <p>There are a variety of approaches to parallel programming, ranging from
      using platform-dependent threading primitives to exotic new languages. The
      advantage of Intel Threading Building Blocks is that it works at a higher
      level than raw threads, yet does not require exotic languages or compilers. You
      can use it with any compiler supporting ISO C++. The library differs from
      typical threading packages in the following ways: 
    </p>
 
    <ul> 
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Intel Threading Building Blocks enables you to specify 
            <em>logical paralleism</em> instead of threads</strong>. Most threading
          packages require you to specify threads. Programming directly in terms of
          threads can be tedious and lead to inefficient programs, because threads are
          low-level, heavy constructs that are close to the hardware. Direct programming
          with threads forces you to efficiently map logical tasks onto threads. In
          contrast, the Intel Threading Building Blocks run-time library automatically
          maps logical parallelism onto threads in a way that makes efficient use of
          processor resources. 
        </p>
 
      </li>
 
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Intel Threading Building Blocks targets 
            <em>threading for performance</em></strong>. Most general-purpose
          threading packages support many different kinds of threading, such as threading
          for asynchronous events in graphical user interfaces. As a result,
          general-purpose packages tend to be low-level tools that provide a foundation,
          not a solution. Instead, Intel Threading Building Blocks focuses on the
          particular goal of parallelizing computationally intensive work, delivering
          higher-level, simpler solutions. 
        </p>
 
      </li>
 
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Intel Threading Building Blocks is 
            <em>compatible</em> with other threading packages.</strong> Because the
          library is not designed to address all threading problems, it can coexist
          seamlessly with other threading packages. 
        </p>
 
      </li>
 
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Intel Threading Building Blocks emphasizes 
            <em>scalable, data parallel programming</em></strong>. Breaking a program
          up into separate functional blocks, and assigning a separate thread to each
          block is a solution that typically does not scale well since typically the
          number of functional blocks is fixed. In contrast, Intel Threading Building
          Blocks emphasizes 
          <em>data-parallel</em> programming, enabling multiple threads to work
          on different parts of a collection. Data-parallel programming scales well to
          larger numbers of processors by dividing the collection into smaller pieces.
          With data-parallel programming, program performance increases as you add
          processors. 
        </p>
 
      </li>
 
      <li> 
        <p><strong>Intel Threading Building Blocks relies on 
            <em>generic programming</em></strong>. Traditional libraries specify
          interfaces in terms of specific types or base classes. Instead, Intel
          Threading Building Blocks uses generic programming. The essence of generic
          programming is writing the best possible algorithms with the fewest
          constraints. The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a good example of
          generic programming in which the interfaces are specified by 
          <em>requirements</em> on types. For example, C++ STL has a template
          function 
          <samp class="codeph">sort</samp> that sorts a sequence abstractly defined in
          terms of iterators on the sequence. The requirements on the iterators are: 
        </p>
 
        <ul> 
          <li> 
            <p>Provide random access 
            </p>
 
          </li>
 
          <li> 
            <p>The expression 
              <samp class="codeph">*i&lt;*j</samp> is true if the item pointed to by
              iterator 
              <samp class="codeph">i</samp> should precede the item pointed to by iterator
              
              <samp class="codeph">j</samp>, and false otherwise. 
            </p>
 
          </li>
 
          <li> 
            <p>The expression 
              <samp class="codeph">swap(*i,*j)</samp> swaps two elements. 
            </p>
 
          </li>
 
        </ul>
 
      </li>
 
    </ul>
 
    <p>Specification in terms of requirements on types enables the template to
      sort many different representations of sequences, such as vectors and deques.
      Similarly, the Intel Threading Building Blocks templates specify requirements
      on types, not particular types, and thus adapt to different data
      representations. Generic programming enables Intel Threading Building Blocks
      to deliver high performance algorithms with broad applicability.
