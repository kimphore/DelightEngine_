		<p>Write a message to memory and have another processor read it on
		  hardware that does not have a sequentially consistent memory model. 
		</p>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Context</h2> 
		 
		<p>The problem normally arises only when unsynchronized threads
		  concurrently act on a memory location, or are using reads and writes to create
		  synchronization. High level synchronization constructs normally include
		  mechanisms that prevent unwanted reordering. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Modern hardware and compilers can reorder memory operations in a way
		  that preserves the order of a thread's operation from its viewpoint, but not as
		  observed by other threads. A serial common idiom is to write a message and mark
		  it as ready to ready as shown in the following code: 
		</p>
 
		<pre>bool Ready;
std::string Message;
 
void Send( const std::string&amp; src ) {. // Executed by thread 1
   Message=src;
   Ready = true;
}
 
bool Receive( std::string&amp; dst ) {    // Executed by thread 2
   bool result = Ready;
   if( result ) dst=Message;
   return result;              // Return true if message was received.
}</pre> 
		<p>Two key assumptions of the code are: 
		</p>
 
		<ol class="abc"> 
		  <li> 
			 <p><samp class="codeph">Ready</samp> does not become true until 
				<samp class="codeph">Message</samp> is written. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p><samp class="codeph">Message</samp> is not read until 
				<samp class="codeph">Ready</samp> becomes true. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		</ol>
 
		<p>These assumptions are trivially true on uniprocessor hardware.
		  However, they may break on multiprocessor hardware. Reordering by the hardware
		  or compiler can cause the sender's writes to appear out of order to the
		  receiver (thus breaking condition a) or the receiver's reads to appear out of
		  order (thus breaking condition b).

	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2> 
		 
		<p>Change the flag from 
		  <samp class="codeph">bool</samp> to 
		  <samp class="codeph">tbb::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</samp> for the flag that indicates
		  when the message is ready. Here is the previous example, with modifications
		  shown in 
		  <samp class="codeph"><span class="color(blue)" style="color:blue"><strong>bold font</strong></span></samp>. 
		</p>
 
		<pre><span class="color(blue)" style="color:blue"><strong>tbb::atomic&lt;</strong></span>bool<span class="color(blue)" style="color:blue"><strong>&gt;</strong></span> Ready;
std::string Message;
 
void Send( const std::string&amp; src ) {. // Executed by thread 1
   Message=src;
   Ready = true;
}
 
bool Receive( std::string&amp; dst ) {    // Executed by thread 2
   bool result = Ready;
   if( result ) dst=Message;
   return result;              // Return true if message was received.
}</pre> 
		<p>A write to a 
		  <samp class="codeph">tbb::atomic</samp> value has 
		  <em>release</em> semantics, which means that all of its prior writes will
		  be seen before the releasing write. A read from 
		  <samp class="codeph">tbb::atomic</samp> value has 
		  <em>acquire</em> semantics, which means that all of its subsequent reads
		  will happen after the acquiring read. The implementation of 
		  <samp class="codeph">tbb::atomic</samp> ensures that both the compiler and the
		  hardware observe these ordering constraints. 
		</p>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Variations</h2> 
		 
		<p>Higher level synchronization constructs normally include the necessary
		  <em>acquire</em> and 
		  <em>release</em> fences. For example, mutexes are normally implemented
		  such that acquisition of a lock has 
		  <em>acquire</em> semantics and release of a lock has 
		  <em>release</em> semantics. Thus a thread that acquires a lock on a mutex
		  always sees any memory writes done by another thread before it released a lock
		  on that mutex. 
		</p>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Non Solutions</h2> 
		 
		<p>Mistaken solutions are so often proposed that it is worth
		  understanding why they are wrong. 
		</p>
 
		<p>One common mistake is to assume that declaring the flag with the 
		  <samp class="codeph">volatile</samp> keyword solves the problem. Though the 
		  <samp class="codeph">volatile</samp> keyword forces a write to happen immediately,
		  it generally has no effect on the visible ordering of that write with respect
		  to other memory operations.
		</p>
 
		<p>Another mistake is to assume that conditionally executed code cannot
		  happen before the condition is tested. However, the compiler or hardware may
		  speculatively hoist the conditional code above the condition. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Similarly, it is a mistake to assume that a processor cannot read the
		  target of a pointer before reading the pointer. A modern processor does not
		  read individual values from main memory. It reads cache lines. The target of a
		  pointer may be in a cache line that has already been read before the pointer
		  was read, thus giving the appearance that the processor presciently read the
		  pointer target.
