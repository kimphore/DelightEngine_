  <h1 class="topictitle1">Communication Between Graphs</h1>
 
   
  <div> 
	 <p>All graph nodes require a reference to a graph object as one of the
		arguments to their constructor. It is only safe to construct edges between
		nodes that are part of the same graph. An edge expresses the topology of your
		graph to the runtime library. Connecting two nodes in different graphs can make
		it difficult to reason about whole graph operations, such as calls to 
		<span class="keyword">graph::wait_for_all</span> and exception handling. To
		optimize performance, the library may make calls to a node's predecessor or
		successor at times that are unexpected by the user. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>If two graphs must communicate, do NOT create an edge between them, but
		instead use explicit calls to 
		<span class="keyword">try_put</span>. This will prevent the runtime library from
		making any assumptions about the relationship of the two nodes, and therefore
		make it easier to reason about events that cross the graph boundaries. However,
		it may still be difficult to reason about whole graph operations. For example,
		consider the graphs below: 
	 </p>
 
	 <pre>    graph g;
    function_node&lt; int, int &gt; n1( g, 1, [](int i) -&gt; int { 
        cout &lt;&lt; "n1\n"; 
        spin_for(i); 
        return i; 
    } );
    function_node&lt; int, int &gt; n2( g, 1, [](int i) -&gt; int { 
        cout &lt;&lt; "n2\n"; 
        spin_for(i); 
        return i; 
    } );
    make_edge( n1, n2 );

    graph g2;
    function_node&lt; int, int &gt; m1( g2, 1, [](int i) -&gt; int { 
        cout &lt;&lt; "m1\n"; 
        spin_for(i); 
        return i; 
    } );
    function_node&lt; int, int &gt; m2( g2, 1, [&amp;](int i) -&gt; int { 
        cout &lt;&lt; "m2\n"; 
        spin_for(i); 
        n1.try_put(i); 
        return i; 
    } );
    make_edge( m1, m2 );

    m1.try_put( 1 );

    // The following call returns immediately:
    g.wait_for_all();
    // The following call returns after m1 &amp; m2
    g2.wait_for_all();

    // we reach here before n1 &amp; n2 are finished
    // even though wait_for_all was called on both graphs
</pre> 
	 <p>In the example above, 
		<span class="keyword">m1.try_put(1)</span> sends a message to node 
		<span class="keyword">m1</span>, which runs its body and then sends a message to
		node 
		<span class="keyword">m2</span>. Next, node 
		<span class="keyword">m2</span> runs its body and sends a message to 
		<span class="keyword">n1</span> using an explicit 
		<span class="keyword">try_put</span>. In turn, 
		<span class="keyword">n1</span> runs its body and sends a message to 
		<span class="keyword">n2</span>. The runtime library does not consider 
		<span class="keyword">m2</span> to be a predecessor of 
		<span class="keyword">n1</span> since no edge exists. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>If you want to wait until all of the tasks spawned by these graphs are
		done, you need to call the function 
		<span class="keyword">wait_for_all</span> on both graphs. However, because there is
		cross-graph communication, the order of the calls is important. In the
		(incorrect) code segment above, the first call to 
		<span class="keyword">g.wait_for_all()</span> returns immediately because there are
		no tasks yet active in 
		<span class="keyword">g</span>; the only tasks that have been spawned by then
		belong to 
		<span class="keyword">g2</span>. The call to 
		<span class="keyword">g2.wait_for_all</span> returns after both 
		<span class="keyword">m1</span> and 
		<span class="keyword">m2</span> are done, since they belong to 
		<span class="keyword">g2</span>; the call does not however wait for 
		<span class="keyword">n1</span> and 
		<span class="keyword">n2</span>, since they belong to 
		<span class="keyword">g</span>. The end of this code segment is therefore reached
		before 
		<span class="keyword">n1</span> and 
		<span class="keyword">n2</span> are done. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>If the calls to 
		<span class="keyword">wait_for_all</span> are swapped, the code works as expected: 
	 </p>
 
	 <pre>    g2.wait_for_all();
    g.wait_for_all();

    // all tasks are done
</pre> 
	 <p>While it is not too difficult to reason about how these two very small
		graphs interact, the interaction of two larger graphs, perhaps with cycles,
		will be more difficult to understand. Therefore, communication between nodes in
		different graphs should be done with caution. 
	 </p>
