  <h1 class="topictitle1">Lock Pathologies</h1>
 
   
  <div> 
	 <p>Locks can introduce performance and correctness problems. If you are new
		to locking, here are some of the problems to avoid: 
	 </p>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Deadlock</h2> 
		 
		<p>Deadlock happens when threads are trying to acquire more than one
		  lock, and each holds some of the locks the other threads need to proceed. More
		  precisely, deadlock happens when: 
		</p>
 
		<ul> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>There is a cycle of threads 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Each thread holds at least one lock on a mutex, and is waiting on
				a mutex for which the 
				<em>next</em> thread in the cycle already has a lock. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p>No thread is willing to give up its lock. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
		<p>Think of classic gridlock at an intersection – each car has "acquired"
		  part of the road, but needs to "acquire" the road under another car to get
		  through. Two common ways to avoid deadlock are: 
		</p>
 
		<ul> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Avoid needing to hold two locks at the same time. Break your
				program into small actions in which each can be accomplished while holding a
				single lock. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Always acquire locks in the same order. For example, if you have
				"outer container" and "inner container" mutexes, and need to acquire a lock on
				one of each, you could always acquire the "outer sanctum" one first. Another
				example is "acquire locks in alphabetical order" in a situation where the locks
				have names. Or if the locks are unnamed, acquire locks in order of the mutex’s
				numerical addresses. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Use atomic operations instead of locks. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Convoying</h2> 
		 
		<p>Another common problem with locks is 
		  <em>convoying</em>. Convoying occurs when the operating system interrupts
		  a thread that is holding a lock. All other threads must wait until the
		  interrupted thread resumes and releases the lock. Fair mutexes can make the
		  situation even worse, because if a waiting thread is interrupted, all the
		  threads behind it must wait for it to resume. 
		</p>
 
		<p>To minimize convoying, try to hold the lock as briefly as possible.
		  Precompute whatever you can before acquiring the lock. 
		</p>
 
		<p>To avoid convoying, use atomic operations instead of locks where
		  possible.
