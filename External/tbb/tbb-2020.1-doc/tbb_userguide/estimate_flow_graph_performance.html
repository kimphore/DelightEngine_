  <h1 class="topictitle1">Estimating Flow Graph Performance</h1>

  
  <div>
	 <p> The performance or scalability of a flow graph is not easy to predict.
		However there are a few key points that can guide you in estimating the limits
		on performance and speedup of some graphs.
	 </p>

	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">The Critical Path Limits the Scalability in a Dependence
		  Graph</h2>
		
		<p>A critical path is the most time consuming path from a node with no
		  predecessors to a node with no successors. In a dependence graph, the execution
		  of the nodes along a path cannot be overlapped since they have a strict
		  ordering. Therefore, for a dependence graph, the critical path limits
		  scalability.
		</p>

		<p>More formally, let
		  <span class="keyword">T</span> be the total time consumed by all of the nodes in
		  your graph if executed sequentially. Then let
		  <span class="keyword">C</span> be the time consumed along the path that takes the
		  most time. The nodes along this path cannot be overlapped even in a parallel
		  execution. Therefore, even if all other paths are executed in parallel with
		  <span class="keyword">C</span>, the wall clock time for the parallel execution is
		  at least
		  <span class="keyword">C</span>, and the maximum possible speedup (ignoring
		  microarchitectural and memory effects) is
		  <span class="keyword">T/C</span>.
		</p>

	 </div>

	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">There is Overhead in Spawning a Node's Body as a Task</h2>
		
		<p>The bodies of
		  <span class="keyword">source_nodes</span>,
		  <span class="keyword">function_nodes</span>,
		  <span class="keyword">continue_nodes</span> and
		  <span class="keyword">multifunction_nodes</span> execute within spawned tasks by
		  default. This means that you need to take into account the overhead of task
		  scheduling when estimating the time it takes for a node to execute its body.
		  All of the rules of thumb for determining the appropriate granularity of tasks
		  therefore also apply to node bodies as well. If you have many fine-grained
		  nodes in your flow graph, the impact of these overheads can noticeably impact
		  your performance. However, depending on the graph structure, you can reduce
		  such overheads by using <span class="keyword">lightweight</span> policy with these nodes.
