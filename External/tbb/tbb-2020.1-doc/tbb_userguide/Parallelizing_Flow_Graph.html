  <div> 
	 <p>In addition to loop parallelism, the Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB)
		library also supports graph parallelism. It's possible to create graphs that
		are highly scalable, but it is also possible to create graphs that are
		completely sequential. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>Using graph parallelism, computations are represented by nodes and the
		communication channels between these computations are represented by edges.
		When a node in the graph receives a message, a task is spawned to execute its
		body object on the incoming message. Messages flow through the graph across the
		edges that connect the nodes. The following sections present two examples of
		applications that can be expressed as graphs. For more information on tasks,
		see the <strong>See Also</strong> section below.
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The following figure shows a 
		<em>streaming</em> or 
		<em>data flow</em> application where a sequence of values is processed as
		each value passes through the nodes in the graph. In this example, the sequence
		is created by a function 
		<span class="keyword">F</span>. For each value in the sequence, 
		<span class="keyword">G</span> squares the value and 
		<span class="keyword">H</span> cubes the value. 
		<span class="keyword">J</span> then takes each of the squared and cubed values and
		adds them to a global 
		<span class="keyword">sum</span>. After all values in the sequence are completely
		processed, 
		<span class="keyword">sum</span> is equal to the sum of the sequence of squares and
		cubes from 1 to 10. In a streaming or data flow graph, the values actually flow
		across the edges; the output of one node becomes the input of its successor(s).

	 <p>The following graphic shows a different form of graph application. In
		this example, a dependence graph is used to establish a partial ordering among
		the steps for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. In this partial
		ordering, you must first get the bread before spreading the peanut butter or
		jelly on the bread. You must spread on the peanut butter before you put away
		the peanut butter jar, and likewise spread on the jelly before you put away the
		jelly jar. And, you need to spread on both the peanut butter and jelly before
		putting the two slices of bread together. This is a partial ordering because,
		for example, it doesn't matter if you spread on the peanut butter first or the
		jelly first. It also doesn't matter if you finish making the sandwich before
		putting away the jars. 
		<div class="fignone" id="dependence_graph_make_sandwitch"><span class="figcap">Dependence Graph for Making a Sandwich</span> 
		  <br /><div class="imagecenter"><img src="Images/flow_graph_complex.jpg" width="440" height="337" align="center" /></div><br /> 
		</div>
 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>While it can be inferred that resources, such as the bread, or the jelly
		jar, are shared between ordered steps, it is not explicit in the graph.
		Instead, only the required ordering of steps is explicit in a dependence graph.
		For example, you must "Put jelly on 1 slice" 
		<strong> 
		  <em>before</em> 
		</strong> you "Put away jelly jar". 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The flow graph interface in the Intel TBB library allows you to express
		data flow and dependence graphs such as these, as well as more complicated
		graphs that include cycles, conditionals, buffering and more. If you express
		your application using the flow graph interface, the runtime library spawns
		tasks to exploit the parallelism that is present in the graph. For example, in
		the first example above, perhaps two different values might be squared in
		parallel, or the same value might be squared and cubed in parallel. Likewise in
		the second example, the peanut butter might be spread on one slice of bread in
		parallel with the jelly being spread on the other slice. The interface
		expresses what is legal to execute in parallel, but allows the runtime library
		to choose at runtime what will be executed in parallel. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The support for graph parallelism is contained within the namespace 
		<span class="keyword">tbb::flow</span> and is defined in the 
		<span class="filepath">flow_graph.h 
		</span>header file.
