  <div>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        For applications that need to control CPU-specific settings for floating-point computations,
        there are two ways to propagate desired settings to tasks executed by Intel&reg; Threading 
        Building Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB) task scheduler:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a task_arena or the task scheduler for a given application thread are initialized,
            they capture the current floating-point settings of the thread;
          </li>

          <li>
            The class task_group_context has a method to capture the current floating-point
            settings.
          </li>

        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        By default, worker threads use the floating-point settings captured during initialization of
        an application thread's implicit arena or explicit task_arena. These settings are applied to
        all parallel computations within the task_arena or started by the application thread, until
        that thread terminates its task scheduler instance. If the thread later re-initializes the
        task scheduler, new settings are captured.
      </p>

      <p>
        For finer control over floating point behavior, a thread may capture the current settings in
        a task group context. It can be done at context creation if a special flag is passed to the 
        constructor:
      </p>

      <p>
        <pre>
task_group_context ctx( task_group_context::isolated,
                        task_group_context::default_traits | task_group_context::fp_settings );
        </pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        or by a call to the method <samp class="codeph">capture_fp_settings</samp>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <pre>
task_group_context ctx;
ctx.capture_fp_settings();
        </pre>
      </p>

      <p>
        The task group context can then be passed to most Intel TBB parallel algorithms (including
        <samp class="codeph">flow::graph</samp>) to ensure that all tasks related to this algorithm use the
        specified floating-point settings. It is possible to execute parallel algorithms with
        different floating-point settings captured to separate contexts, even at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Floating-point settings captured to a task group context prevail over the settings captured
        during task scheduler initialization. Thus if a context is passed to a parallel algorithm
        then floating-point settings captured to the context are used. Otherwise, if floating-point
        settings are not captured to the context, or a context is not explicitly specified, then the
        settings captured during task scheduler initialization are used.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a nested call to a parallel algorithm not using a task group context with explicitly
        captured floating-point settings, the settings from the outer level are used. If neither of
        the outer level contexts captured floating-point settings then the settings captured during
        task scheduler initialization are used.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is guaranteed that:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Floating-point settings captured to a task group context or at the moment of task
            scheduler initialization are applied to all tasks executed by the task scheduler.
          </li>

          <li>
            An invocation of an Intel TBB parallel algorithm does not visibly modify the
            floating-point settings of the calling thread, even if the algorithm is executed with
            different settings.
          </li>

        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        <div class="Note"><h3 class="NoteTipHead">CAUTION</h3> 
          The above guarantees only apply in the following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The user code inside a task either does not change floating-point settings, or reverts
              any modifications and restores previous settings before the end of the task.
            </li>

            <li>
              Intel TBB task scheduler observers are not used to set or modify floating point
              settings.
            </li>

          </ul>

          Otherwise, the stated guarantees are not valid and the behavior related to floating-point
          settings is undefined.
